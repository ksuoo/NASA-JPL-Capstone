[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:33
And then at an even higher level, which could be maybe the science aspect that I was telling you before.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:38
Uh, I see you guys are transcribing the meeting.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:40
Um, so I'm gonna have to do proper now.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:45
Um, so, um, the…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:49
I worked on that for about, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:52
there's a lot more to tell you if you want to know more, but I worked on that for about 5 years.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:37:57
Uh, then I worked on a number of missions, uh, namely…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:01
Mars 2020, the Perseverance rover.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:05
Uh, and it had a helicopter

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:08
I also worked on Europe at Clipper, which is a mission that launched, uh,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:13
a few months ago, it's going to a Moon of Jupiter called Europa, which might have… it's the best suited

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:19
placing the solar system outside of Earth.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:22
to have, uh, live, because it has… it's an… it's an ocean world.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:27
It's a… it's a moon of… it's a moon that has a crust of ice, water ice,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:34
But then under that water ice is actual…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:38
liquid water. And…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:40
So, there is that warmth that happens from the liquid water plus, um, it has salts and other elements that could be conducive to life.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:52
Um, there is liquid water because of the gravitational forces that Jupiter makes onto the

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:38:58
the moon, right? So it has an eccentric orbit, which is like an elliptical orbit, and because it has an elliptical orbit,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:05
that kind of, like, deforms and creates, like, tension.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:09
Um, on the… on the geology of… of that… of that moon, right? Uh, and then that…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:14
warms up the moon quite a bit.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:18
Uh, so much so that there's liquid water under the…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:21
the ice crust. Um, so it's a mission that's going to orbit Jupiter, and it's actually…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:27
gonna take a lot of data from Europa.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:30
And we wanted to do a follow-up mission that's, uh, to land on the moon, and then maybe make a hole in the ice, and then maybe, like,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:39
put a little submarine into the water or something, but that's in the future.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:43
Um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:44
Um, I worked on missions to asteroids,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:47
So the asteroid belt, um, went to an asteroid called Ceres,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:52
Which has been made popular by…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:54
the Expanse. I don't know if you guys watched that show or you read the books, but…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:39:59
It's a… it's a…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:01
It's an interesting place, and then another mission, it's a Psyche mission, which is, uh, it's going to… it's actually traveling to right now, to an asteroid in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:12
Um, where…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:15
Uh, it's a metallic world, so it's what we think was going to become a…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:21
a proper planet, but it never became a planet, so it just shows the exposed core of what we think was going to become a planet, and if we look at it, then we can understand how the core of our

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:33
planet looks like, and, you know, what it's composed of by looking at

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:39
that asteroid.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:40
Uh, and it's also one of those places that's, uh, I think it shows up in the news every now and then, because it has

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:46
more gold than there is in Earth, or something like that, right? So…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:50
Um, it's going there, it's gonna reach, uh…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:55
the asteroid in a couple of years.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:40:59
Um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:01
But we have a lot going on at JPL, so JPL is the most important center.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:06
for improbic exploration in the world. We make the rovers that go to Mars, we make rovers that go to the Moon, we make deep space spacecraft. We actually predate NASA.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:17
quite a bit. We were a project from Caltech.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:20
actually belong to Caltech.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:22
Um, and it was funded by a few, uh, PhD students that were blowing up

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:30
rockheads and things in… here in LA, and they were told to go to the mountains, and then they built a lab there.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:36
And then they got a contract from, um, the military to build, um, doing…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:42
World War II to build jet-assisted takeoff, which is you put a jet, you put a rocket,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:48
onto the wings of an aircraft so that they can take off in a short runway.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:52
So that was the first thing that we did, and then we were the first ones to

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:41:57
planned on Venus, on Mars, you know, we're talking about the 60s, right? So before…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:03
50s and 60s, before

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:05
humans landed on the moon, we were already landing things on different planets in the solar system.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:12
Um, might not be known by a lot of people, but we…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:16
We did all of that, and most of the things that we did were actually very helpful in landing humans on the moon.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:23
Um, but going back to what I was telling you, so then I worked on a number of missions, then I joined the Flight Software Navionics, uh, system section. I'm the

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:33
deputy… one of the managers of that section.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:36
And that section is just a group of people… just a section means that I'm a manager that manages managers.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:43
Right? Uh, and we own Flight Software Development, so the software that runs on the spacecraft.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:50
Um, we also create the testbeds, the hardware testbeds that run… that we use to run, you know,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:42:58
the… to test before we actually, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:02
ship the spacecraft to space.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:04
I'm gonna stop there, because otherwise I'm gonna take too long, but if you have any questions, let me know.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:10
Um,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:12
Yeah. And by the way, let me check my calendar, because I think that I have a meeting

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:18
Uh, I have a meeting in 15 minutes.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:21
So, if you guys want…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:24
I know that I spent too much time, and I apologize for that, but, um, maybe we can do introductions later, finish those, and then we can talk about the project, and I can tell you what I think we should do.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:34
Um, okay, so what I had

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:38
Uh, the idea that I had is…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:41
Um, we…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:43
LLMs and VLMs are something that we want to start deploying in space.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:49
Um, the problem that we had up until now is that

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:43:52
There wasn't enough compute on the computers that we were shipping into space to run a full-run LLM. They used a lot of power, those computers are not

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:02
radiation resistant.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:05
Um… but…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:07
um, their cuts, right? They're…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:09
off the shelf, and you can buy them. So, we could just, like, put

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:14
one or two on a spacecraft.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:16
And then there would be a main computer, that would be radiation-hardened,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:20
And then if the computers that would be running the VLMs or LLMs die, that's fine, but the main computer still, you know,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:27
works okay.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:29
Um, and again, as a matter of fact, we had the…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:33
Mars Ingenuity Helicopter that run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon, which is a, you know,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:39
chip that runs on a phone, right? On an Android phone.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:42
Um, from a few years ago.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:44
So, those chips, as you can imagine, they're pretty capable. They can run

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:48
LLMs, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:51
Depending on how much RAM you have, or what kind of size of model you want to run, or how quantized it is.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:44:58
Um, and then we have other applications for LLMs within the defense,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:03
part of JPL, where Earth-orbiting satellites.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:08
And those ones, they don't receive a lot of radiation.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:11
So anyway, bottom line is, um, I would like you to investigate

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:15
Or to develop, so a few things. So, one is…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:20
Research and development of a runtime to be able to run VLMs on

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:27
computing architectures based on RISC-V or ARM.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:33
Um, and…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:34
I'll tell you about that a little bit more in a second.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:38
Um, but the end goal would be to have something that runs on Linux that is able to receive an image, or an image or two, or three, or n images.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:48
Along with a prompt.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:50
And then return text back.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:52
And did our ways…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:45:54
that that's been done for LLMs. You can do that with Ollama on Linux, you can do that with, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:01
Um, there's another one, I forgot, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:05
But anyway, there are other ones. Um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:09
But I don't know that there is one… I think there might be, I'm sure that somebody has done it before, but, um, to do it…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:16
with… with an image also. I can run a local LLM or VLM on my computer, on my Mac,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:24
And then I can just, like, have a UI where I can just, like, drag and drop an image, and I can ask a question about that image.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:30
Uh, and then it gives me the answer.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:32
But what I want to do that… what I want to do is the same thing.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:36
from the command line, or a library, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:38
So the end goal would be to develop a command line tool plus a library that would let you point a path to the local file system where you have an image,

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:47
For a number of images.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:50
And another path where there is a prompt in text format, and then it returns another

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:55
text file, uh, with the output from the LLM.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:46:59
Right? That's the first phase of the project.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:02
The second phase of the project is…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:05
Uh, to evaluate…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:07
a few VLM…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:12
Uh…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:12
versions or sizes to see which ones perform the best in the hardware that we choose.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:21
Uh, it's not a… I don't think it's a complicated project, and I think it's a cool project, because what you guys do…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:26
might end up being used as a library on a spacecraft, potentially in the future, a JPL.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:33
Um, and we have a few…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:37
projects on the line that could benefit from that.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:40
Anyway, I'll stop talking. I think we need to talk more about the project, but…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:44
Do you guys have any question about what I said, or…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:47
Anything that you want to know?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:49
Uh, today, because I think we have time, we can talk a lot more, but, um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:47:54
maybe the main thing that you guys would have to do is to look into how you would compile

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:48:00
a runtime for an LLM to run on Linux, regardless of the computer, right? It could be an x86 computer, but that could be the first investigation that you guys need to do.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:48:12
Okay, any questions?

[Nathan Khazam] 11:48:19
I had a quick question. So, for… I guess this would mainly be relevant in Phase 2.

[Nathan Khazam] 11:48:24
But are we expected to train a bunch of, like, smaller models on real data, and then see how they do? Or are we just, uh, kind of…

[Nathan Khazam] 11:48:32
theoretically evaluating these models to see how they do on the different hardwares.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:48:37
So, for Phase 2, we need to talk more, but you would not be training a model, you would just take a… the model that I think that I would like you to focus on is the JAMA model, which is an open-source model by Google.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:48:49
Uh, and if you go to Hugging Face, I don't know if you've ever been to Hugging Face, but on Hugging Face, there are many versions of that model, uh, of different quantized versions.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:48:59
different sizes, and what we want to do is try to assess which one of those models provides the better answers for the hardware we are trying to run it on. And we don't need to evaluate different

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:10
hardware levels, unless we have it, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:14
Ideally, also, the support of that that library provides.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:18
So, one question that I had for your, um, I don't know if it was who it was, but it was somebody from CU that… that I talked to before, uh…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:27
you know, I wrote that, you know, the…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:29
project. Um, request. Um…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:34
I asked if you guys had any Raspberry Pis. Do you guys know if you have Raspberry Pis over there?

[Parker Secrest] 11:49:44
I'm sure somewhere we could…

[jerry] 11:49:44
I know the eStore does.

[Parker Secrest] 11:49:46
Yeah, I'm sure somewhere we could find them.

[Kaile Suoo] 11:49:47
We definitely can get access to them, I think.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:51
So, I think that one of the things you guys need to do is figure out what Raspberry Pis you have access to, or what

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:49:58
single-board computers, you guys have access to it. Maybe you guys have Raspberry Pis

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:02
Single-board computer, as you guys have access to it. Maybe you guys have Raspberry Pis, or you guys have other computers that we can leverage.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:05
Um, but we would be running our tests on those, uh, and the library should.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:12
I really take advantage of the GPU or the DSP, or the multi-core computer on board, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:20
Um. It would be a lot different, I think, if we were to optimize for a Snapdragon or other kinds of.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:28
Computers, uh, because those ones, they have a much more capable GPU on board, and then we would need to check that the runtime.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:37
Takes advantage of those. But bottom line, even if it takes, you know, even if it takes.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:43
30 minutes to get a response back from the LLM, that's fine. I mean, I'm fine with that.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:48
Because, you know, this can be batch requests that we make to the secondary, you know.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:50:53
Coprocessor, AI coprocessor, like I mentioned, right? Uh, and if they take long, that's fine, because it can… they can be used for science. But ideally, you want to model, or we want to.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:04
Capture, uh, some benchmarks in terms of performance on each hardware platform that we have access to.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:10
So I know that I'm saying a lot, I don't want to make it more confusing than it is, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:14
But, um, hopefully you guys understand what I'm… sitting here. We just want to create a library in a runtime.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:23
That gets a number of image files from the file system, plus a prompt file.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:29
And then it returns text, right, based on that prompt and those images.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:34
We're gonna be… there is a lot of data on the internet about how to do that. I just haven't done the research myself.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:40
But I know that there is, right? Um.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:44
I know that I can run OLAMA on my computer, which is an open source project, and it can do that.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:50
Right, so I'm guessing that we can find out how Olama does it, and then we just, like, try to come up with a library of our own to do it, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:51:58
Um, and then the second part of the project is one that is maybe more undefined.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:52:03
Is how do we assess the performance of different versions of the model with a hardware that CU has there?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:52:11
Okay. It's not… it's not a complicated thing, it's just… it's… it's an easy thing.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:52:19
Uh, but once you start to go deeper into it, there's gonna be more things that we might have to discuss, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:52:28
Okay. Any more questions? You guys are so shiny.

[Parker Secrest] 11:52:35
Sounds pretty good

[jerry] 11:52:36
Uh… I don't have a technical question, but more of, like, a logistical question.

[jerry] 11:52:42
Uh, how often… Should we meet with you?

[jerry] 11:52:46
Or if you're available to me every other week, or every week.

[jerry] 11:52:51
As well as, like, reach out to Raymond as well. Oh…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:52:51
So when we… Oh, Raymond is not part of this. So, Raymond is a contract. Yeah, Raymond is a contracts person, he's just not part of this. He's the… he's just the person that helped me create the contract with the… with the university.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:07
Um, I'm gonna be your contact. Um… So, about how frequently do we meet? Uh…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:15
So initially, we tried to meet every… so I've been doing this for 9 years with CEO, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:21
Um… Uh, I think we should meet once a week.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:28
Um, until you guys get a grasp of what… you need to do, and then we can switch to a…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:35
You know, every other week cadence. Um, and then in terms of what time works.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:42
Um… Let me see…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:53:53
Do Mondays at your 1PM work?

[Kaile Suoo] 11:53:58
Uh, it works for me.

[Parker Secrest] 11:54:01
That's fine for me, yeah.

[Nathan Khazam] 11:54:03
Should be okay.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:03
Because, I mean, that's my lunch time, and then I can have maybe, like… I can have more time to talk to you guys.

[peyton] 11:54:04
That works.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:10
Um, so I can just show up, and I don't have typically meetings during lunchtime.

[Parker Secrest] 11:54:15
Is that… sorry, did you mean, uh, 1PM… mountain or Pacific.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:19
Yeah, I meant 1PM… 1PM your time, so mountain time. Yeah.

[Parker Secrest] 11:54:22
Okay, cool.

[Kaile Suoo] 11:54:23
Okay, yeah, one's good.

[peyton] 11:54:25
That works.

[Patrick Hunt] 11:54:26
That works for me

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:29
Okay, so the only conflict that I will have with that is… actually next week, uh, I will have time from 12.30, so your 1.30.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:41
To 2, but then the other… the weeks, uh, so all the other weeks after, I'm free the whole hour from 1 to 2.

[Kaile Suoo] 11:54:48
Okay, yeah.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:54:54
Okay, so let's say next, so next meeting will be next week at 1.30 to 2 p.m.

[Parker Secrest] 11:54:54
Um, well…

[Parker Secrest] 11:55:02
That works.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:04
And then, obviously, your calendar will change over the quarters, and we'll have to adjust.

[Parker Secrest] 11:55:12
Yeah.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:25
For the, um… are we gonna use the same link for Zoom?

[Kaile Suoo] 11:55:28
Yeah, I can try to set up, like, a recurring invitation. So, like, for now, I'll do 1.30, and then following weeks, I'll do 1.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:31
Yeah, can you do that, yeah.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:36
Yeah, can you do that? That would be better.

[Kaile Suoo] 11:55:38
Yeah, I'll send it after the meeting.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:49
Okay, so I'm gonna have to go in 5 minutes. Anything else that you guys want to cover?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:55:59
I think we don't have enough time for… presentations, but I mean introductions, but, um, if you have any questions, we can do it.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:05
Deal with it right now.

[Parker Secrest] 11:56:10
I think it sounds like… We don't, so… just until next week, doing our initial…

[Parker Secrest] 11:56:17
Kind of research into this. Um… meat.

[Parker Secrest] 11:56:22
At 1.30, right? So…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:25
Yeah. So I think that what you need to do now is to try to figure out what.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:28
Kind of hardware you have access to, mostly single-board computers. If you have no single-board computers, then we can think about other options.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:38
Um, but ideally, you find… uh… in the ideal case, you know, like, you would find…

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:46
Uh, a few Raspberry Pis of different memory sizes and capabilities.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:56:54
The not-so-good-but-still-good, you know. Case would be one in which we have only one type of Raspberry Pi.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:03
Uh, and the worst case scenario would be one in which we don't have any single-board computers.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:07
And when I say Raspberry Pi, what I mean is any… any single-board computer that can be, you know, that's either ARM.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:13
Or RISC-5, which is another architecture, right? Um, I don't know if you know the Beagle Boards, but the Beagle Awards are also, like, single-board computers, and I think that they have RISC-V versions, and RISC-V is an open ISA.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:28
How are you… how familiar are you guys with, um… computer architecture.

[Patrick Hunt] 11:57:39
Vague

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:41
Okay. So, an ISA is an instruction set. Right, architecture. Uh, it's, um, typically, you know, if you have a Mac now, they run on ARM architecture, but with extensions from Apple, and if you have a PC, typically it will be an x86, x64.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:57:58
Instruction set by Intel. Um, the single-board computers, they typically operate in the R… they're either ARM, which is.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:05
Proprietary by Arm Holdings Limited. Uh, which is a UK company, uh, right, and then they license their instruction set to companies to develop their own chips.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:18
Um. And then there's another standard called RISC-V, so on RISC, R-I-S-C.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:24
With the used instruction set computer. Dash V, which is an open standard that has been adopted by many.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:31
Companies and space companies and… government, uh, because it's open and they don't have to pay respects to any other company, right?

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:43
Um, and it's also been adopted quite a bit by China, um, because they also… they don't have to deal with American companies either.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:50
Um, but it's an open standard, anybody can build their own computer based on it, and they don't have to pay royalties.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:58:56
So, uh, it's taking… it's taking, uh, a lot of… I think it's being used quite a bit.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:03
Uh, and also, as a matter of fact, the next NASA computers, the main.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:10
Computers that we're thinking of using for our next missions, uh, they're gonna be RISC-V.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:16
So, if you see an ARM computer at RISC-V, they vary a little bit.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:21
Um, but not a lot in the instruction set. But the ARM computers, typically, because there is more commercial investment, they have better GPUs than DSPs.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:32
To run, um, LLMs.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:38
Okay. So I'm gonna have to go. Uh, if you guys send me the invite, then I'll show up at that time.

[Kaile Suoo] 11:59:46
Alright, sounds good.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:47
Okay. Yeah, no problem. Thank you, guys. Take care.

[Parker Secrest] 11:59:48
Great. Yeah, thank you so much for your time.

[jerry] 11:59:49
Great, thank you so much. Yeah.

[Patrick Hunt] 11:59:50
Thanks for being with us.

[Nathan Khazam] 11:59:51
Thank you.

[peyton] 11:59:52
Thank you.

[Parker Secrest] 11:59:54
Alright, you too.

[Patrick Hunt] 11:59:55
You do.

[Marcel (JPL)] 11:59:55
Bye-bye.

[Axel Vandenheuvel] 12:00:01
Did it say that this was being transcribed?

[Nathan Khazam] 12:00:05
I think it popped off, like, halfway through.

[peyton] 12:00:06
Yeah, I have the transcription.

[jerry] 12:00:06
Yeah.

[Patrick Hunt] 12:00:07
At the…

[Axel Vandenheuvel] 12:00:08
Do we have that? Can we upload that to the… the shared file, or whatever, the shared…

[Axel Vandenheuvel] 12:00:15
Folder.

[Nathan Khazam] 12:00:16
Yeah.
