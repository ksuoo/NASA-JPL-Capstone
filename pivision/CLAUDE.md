1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files.
2. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
3. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid super complex changes. Everything is about simplicity. 
4. Main a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out. 
5. Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to read and investigate relevant files before answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer.
6. Make sure that docs stay true. Architecture doc must match current behavior; update diagrams/flows when behavior changes. 
7. Handle failures gracefully and document why any case is out of scope. 
8. Never log secrets; validate/sanitize inputs at boundaries; avoid introducing insecure defaults.
